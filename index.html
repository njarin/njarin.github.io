		<h4>iTunes Reviews</h4>
		<p>&quot;I really love this podcast. It gets better and more mature each episode. The features are a deep dive in nerd culture you wouldn't normally hear about.&quot;</p>
		<p>&quot;I love these guys. I'm always happy to get a little knowledge with my geekification&quot;</p>
		<p>&quot;It's the Christian Louboutin of nerd podcasts, AKA something you didn't know you needed in your life.&quot;</p>
		<p>&quot;This is an amazing podcast even if you are not living in the Pacific NW. I can't wait for more.&quot;</p>
